## Eicorn - *Ecological Impact Calculator*
### A WebApp giving an eco rating and information on the ecological impact of a product from it's barcode

### what is our idea?
We want to make ecological habbits easy and informative to the customer. An easy webapp/application where scanning a barcode
tells you on a scale from 1 to 5 it's carbon footprint and advise you on less impacting products. Additional information such as
**where does the product come from**? **what materials are used**? **How far has it travelled** would be accessable?

##### How would this help?
* individuals would know and chose higher ecological scores. Through the suggestion they would be encouraged to pick the highest
  eco scores
* Compony's would be encouraged to compete on the ecological level. Similar to the NutriScore those who accept to share
  information would appear more transparent and respectful to those who don't.

### How does it work?
Through the main page of the webapp, you can scan or type a barcode number from a product that intrest you.
The web app will then calculate it's carbon footprint impact and give it an eco rating and useful information.

### Why don't we give more information on the product?
Unfortunatly, there is only so much we can get through a codebar. There is no official codebar database so there is no centralisation
of these information. Furthermore some of these information's such as the meterial's in the product are not required to be given so
are close to impossible to access.


### future features
* read barcode from imported photo
* more available data for criterias
* better eco calculation with more criterias
